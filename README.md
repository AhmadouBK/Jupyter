Project Description: Cardiovascular Disease Classification**

Project Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a classification model capable of predicting the presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases based on various medical features.

**Data Used:**
The dataset utilized in this project is extracted from a CSV file (`heart_diseases.csv`) containing medical information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.

Key Project Steps:

1. Data Loading:
   - Medical data is loaded from the CSV file (`heart_diseases.csv`).
   - Missing values are processed or eliminated as needed.

2. Data Exploration:
   - Initial exploration of the data is conducted to understand the distribution of features and labels.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Data is split into training (`X_train`, `y_train`) and test (`X_test`, `y_test`) sets.
   - Features are normalized or scaled as per algorithm requirements.

4. Modeling:
   - Different classification algorithms are employed, including SVM, Random Forest, and MLP.
   - Models are trained on the training set.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Model performances are assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, etc.

6. Results Visualization:
   - Graphs, such as ROC curves and precision-recall curves, are used to visualize model performances.

7. Model Optimization:
   - Model hyperparameters may be adjusted to optimize performance.

8. Handling Class Imbalance:
   - Oversampling (RandomOverSampler) is applied to address class imbalance, particularly when using certain models like SVM.

Results and Future Outlook:
- Model performances are compared to identify the most effective model.
- Further adjustments may be made based on the obtained results.
- The project could be extended by incorporating additional optimization techniques, cross-validation, or exploring alternative algorithms.
